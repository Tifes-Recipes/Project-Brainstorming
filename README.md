Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Mini goals/ sub task creation and dividing it by the days we have to work on the project together and following the agile concept adjusting expectations for deliverability and completion as we go along so everyone is aware each day what we are working on and still left to do.

## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
Describe at least:
What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Equal turns expressing concerns, type out code suggestions or snippets to be reviewed by the team over telling a teammate what to type.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Taking turns navigating and driving
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Honesty during task assigning and assigning based off of strengths and using TA help as a way to have equilibrium in the group in terms of ability
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
An hour before the end of Remo we start our review process which will help us determine if we need to allocate more team members to a particular task assigned to someone to get it done quickly or work through a problem, this way its not like we are coming down on each other and is more in regards to it being our review process which I fell could be more psychologically safe for everyone.
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
review as a team, say for example we pair of in pairs to tackle a task assigned to someone on the team, and say they need more help, we could review as a team, and allocate an additional member or everyone can get involved to brainstorm and get pasted a block.

## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
What hours will you be available to communicate?
6 PM PST - 9:30 PM PST
What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack, Remo
How often will you take breaks?
Once an hour / 10 mins - 15 mins
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Invest an extra 30 mins to an hour in pairs based off availability to work after or before class
How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Slack
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
etiquette as teammates to give equal turns talking, also relying on our daily reviews to voice any concerns, suggestions or comments
How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
No sassy remarks, staying peaceful and positive, equal tuns talking, hearing someone completely even if you don’t agree with them.
Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
Describe at least:
How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Based off strength and during our reviews as a team in Remo
What project management tool will be used?
Asana

## Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
Describe at least:
What components of your project will live on GitHub?
GitHub Pages for deployment, files in repo
How will you share the repository with your teammates?
Everyone on team is contributor with access to ACP to repo
What is your Git flow?
We will work between pair programming and doing it as a group, switching between the driver and navigator. We will make sure that after every change a pull request is checked by the entire group, or at least two members, and that everyone syncs their computer after that pull request has been merged to either the main brach or a branch of our choice. 
Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
How many people must review a PR?
Whoever you are working in a pair with can review, if there is a conflict the whole team would review
Who merges PRs?
Pairs or Team as a whole
How often will you merge?
after every new implementation or getting something working, before starting session do a pull to make sure you are on the current version.
How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
Slack, Remo, and asana
